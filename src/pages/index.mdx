description: Automate with confidence using Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps
---

## Introduction

This lab will focus on leveraging the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management and the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps to improve your efficiency by automating some of the tasks 
that your organization may be executing manually.

The lab consists of a few different exercises that will allow you to understand the capabilities to automate key tasks.  Each section of the lab is intended to be independent and 
can be executed in any order.  The lab exercises include:
- Provision a virtual machine into the IBM public cloud using the service library.  
    In this section, you'll learn how to provision a VM, publish a service to the service library, and modify a service to add additional capabilties.
    One of the key capabilities is how the "manage services" allow you to combine tools like Terraform and Ansible Tower to achieve more complex automations.
    Complex workflows can be achieved via the Composition page and you'll learn how to use the drag and drop capabilities.
- Provision a virtual machine into a VMware environment using the service library.
    In this section, you'll learn how Terraform is leveraged to provision the virtual machine to the public cloud and how parameters are defined and 
    exposed in the service. You'll also see how tags can be defined in the virtual machines and used for other activities such as chargeback reports.
- Use Infrastructure Management view detailed information about your containerized environments and setup chargeback reports

Access credebntials and console URL will be provided for you by lab instructurs in a webex session.
