description: Automate with confidence using Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps
---

## Introduction

This lab will focus on leveraging the Automation component of the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOPs to improve your efficiency by automating some of the tasks 
that your organization may be executing manually.

The lab consists of a few different exercises that will allow you to understand the capabilities to automate key tasks.  Each section of the lab is intended to be independent and 
can be executed in any order.  The lab exercises include:
- Provision a virtual machine into the IBM public cloud using the service library.  
    In this section, you'll learn how to provision a VM, publish a service to the service library, and modify a service to add additional capabilties.
    One of the key capabilities is how the "manage services" allow you to combine tools like Terraform and Ansible Tower to achieve more complex automations.
    Complex workflows can be achieved via the Composition page and you'll learn how to use the drag and drop capabilities.
- Provision a virtual machine into a VMware environment using the service library.
    In this section, you'll learn how Terraform is leveraged to provision the virtual machine to the public cloud and how parameters are defined and 
    exposed in the service. You'll also see how tags can be defined in the virtual machines and used for other activities such as chargeback reports.
- Use Infrastructure Management view detailed information about your containerized environments and setup chargeback reports

## Logging into the Environment

  Before beginning the exercises, take the following steps to login to the soleil environment and access the lab environment.

  After opening your browser and logging into the lab, you'll see an image of a computer.  You will login to this virtual machine and launch a browser to access the lab environment.

  If the background is green, it means the virtual machine is running.  If it is not running, click the start arrow to start the VM
  
  Once the Virtual Machine is running, click on the picture of the computer to open the desktop.

  If prompted, the login password for the virtual machine is **"Passw0rd"**

  For more information on using the soleil environment, scroll towards the bottom of the page.

  After logging into the virtual machine, launch the Chrome browser.  When Chrome opens, 3 tabs will automatically open.  
  - The first tab is the lab guide.
  - The 2nd tab is the Infrastructure Management component of the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOPs.
  - The 3rd tab contains a list of student usernames and passwords.  

  Go to the first tab within the browser and within the browser, click on the following link:   https://cpd-cp4waiops.itzroks-270004w3qr-kgj97r-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/zen/

  Then, go to the 3rd tab and lookup your username and password.  Use that username and password to log into the Automation tools within CP4AIOps.
